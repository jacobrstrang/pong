Two-player online matchmaking Pong game.

This was a project for the Rapid Prototyping and Creative Development class at Washington University in St. Louis
in the fall of 2013.

The code for the actual game was provided by Shane Carr, while the server and client communications were created
by Declan McKelvey-Hembree and myself. Node.js was used to handle socket communications.

The program handles online matchmaking, allowing users to create a username upon login, and request a game with
any other player not already in a match. Matchmaking page is functional, but simple at the current time and would
need to be redesigned for appearance in any type of commercial use. Additional security features may be necessary as
well, such as more effective HTML character escaping.
